// Algorithm to check if a graph is Bipartite: 
// One approach is to check whether the graph is 2-colorable or not using backtracking algorithm m coloring problem. 
// Following is a simple algorithm to find out whether a given graph is Bipartite or not using Breadth First Search (BFS). 
// 1. Assign RED color to the source vertex (putting into set U). 
// 2. Color all the neighbors with BLUE color (putting into set V). 
// 3. Color all neighborâ€™s neighbor with RED color (putting into set U). 
// 4. This way, assign color to all vertices such that it satisfies all the constraints of m way coloring problem where m = 2. 
// 5. While assigning colors, if we find a neighbor which is colored with same color as current vertex, then the graph cannot be colored with 2 vertices (or graph is not Bipartite)
